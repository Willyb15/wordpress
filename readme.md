###Setting Up Drupal and Wordpress
##Set up New Virtual Host
####127.0.0.1 is Local - Then the name
```
sudo vi /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1 local-drupal.com
127.0.0.1 local-furniture-site.com
```
##Download Wordpress
####Go to www.wordpress.org
####Dowload zip of Wordpress 4.5.2 and Extract
#### Save in Folder Open up in Sublime
##Configure Virtual Host in Apache Configuration
#####Apache listening on Port 80 - but no Virtual Host Setup
```
sudo vi /etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName local-furniture.com
  DocumentRoot /Users/Bryant/Desktop/DigitalCrafts/unit4/wordpress/furniture-site

  <Directory "/Users/Bryant/Desktop/DigitalCrafts/unit4/wordpress/furniture-site">
    Allow from all
    Options +Includes +Indexes +FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride all
    Require all granted
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

//Setup drupal as well

<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName local-drupal.com
  DocumentRoot /Users/Bryant/Desktop/DigitalCrafts/unit4/drupal

  <Directory "/Users/Bryant/Desktop/DigitalCrafts/unit4/drupal">
    Allow from all
    Options +Includes +Indexes +FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride all
    Require all granted
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```
##Restart Apache
```
//Syntax Checker
sudo apachectl -t
//Restart Command
sudo apachectl restart
```
###Set Up DataBase 
#####Went into Sequel Pro and created Database with name "Furniture"
#####Update Schema Priviliges for X user
###Update wp-config.php, Save, Run Install (following directions on WP)
#####Copy the code in the "sorry can't get the wp-config.php file"
#####Paste into sublime Save in root directory 
#####Keep following WP directions
#####Check Sequal and see if connected
##Customize Site
####Go to root WP directory in Terminal and Give Apache User ownership of uploads because User owns it now
```
cd unit4/wordpress/furniture-site
cd wp-content
//Give Apache ownership of uploads folder
//Make uploads folder
mkdir uploads
//_www is the Apache User
sudo chown _www uploads/
```
#####That worked. Holy Crap
##Start Using Wordpress Dashboard
##Add plugin
####Go to wordpress.org
####Download plugin
####Save into furniture-site/wp-content/plugins/
####Go to plugins in Dashboard
####Click activate
####Copy ShortCode and Paste into New Post
#####Front-Page.php will overrule index.php
#####We're gonna live in wp-content/themes
